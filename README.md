Git Hook Playground
===================

This is a simple repository that writes some overkill boilerplate code for writing git-hooks. It is
meant to be used in conjunction with [this post]() written at my blog on git-hooks.

Sample Usage
============

For instructions to get started type `make`.

```
build      Construct repository to violate git hook.
resolve    Resolve any issues caught by git hook.
clean      Remove any artifacts
```
